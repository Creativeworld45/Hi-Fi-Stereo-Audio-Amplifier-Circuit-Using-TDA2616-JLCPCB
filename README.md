# Hi-Fi-Stereo-Audio-Amplifier-Circuit-Using-TDA2616-JLCPCB
The TDA2616 is a dual power amplifier circuit. This IC is especially designed for stereo radio and stereo TV. This IC is built with 2*12 watt Hi-Fi audio power amplifier with mute. The TDA2616 IC has a good balance for both channel speaker.
In this Project, we’ll tech you making a Hi-Fi Stereo Amplifier Circuit Using TDA2616 Sound IC. It is a very powerful amplifier circuit and you can make this amplifier circuit at home easily. TDA2616 IC made can produce up to 2*12 watt . You can use this amplifier circuit at your home, office, bike, car , truck and anywhere. This circuit don’t have any humming sound. 

To Make this amplifier circuit , you might need some electronics component. Those component list have to been given below. 
Component List : 
1. Sound IC – TDA 2616 
2. PF – 2A104j (4 Pieces) 
3. Resistor – 2.2 Ohm (2 Pieces)
4. Speaker – 2 Pieces 
5. Power Supply 
6. Heat Sink 
7. Audio Input Cable

Circuit Connection : 

To Make This Amplifier Circuit 1st We Connect 3 & 8 No Leg Of Sound IC. We Know That, We Need 4 Pieces PF – 2a104j. Now  We Connect 1no PF With 9 No Leg Of Sound IC, 2no PF With 1no Leg Of Sound IC, 3no PF With 3no Leg Of Sound IC & 4no PF With 8no Leg Of Sound IC. 
We Also Know That, We Need 2 Pieces 2.2 Ω Resistors. Now We Connect Resistor With 4no Leg Of IC And PF, That PF Is Connected With 3no Leg Of Sound IC. And Connect The Other Resistor With 6no Leg Of IC And PF, That PF Is Connected With 8no Leg Of Sound IC.

To Make This Amplifier Circuit, We Need Dual Power Supply. Dual Power Supply Will Provide Us DC  “+12v”,” -12v” And “G” Voltage. If You Don’t Have Any Idea About Making Dual Power Supply, Then You Can Watch This Video. You’ll Get A Complete Idea About Making A Dual Power Supply.

Now, We Connect Power Supply With The Amplifier Circuit. Connect “DC +12v”  With 7no Leg Of Sound IC, “DC -12v”  With 5no Leg Of Sound IC & “G”  Voltage With 8no Leg Of Sound IC. 

Now We Need To Connect Audio Input Cable With The Amplifier Circuit. While It Is A Stereo Amplifier Circuit, We Need To Connect 3 Cable With The Circuit. Now We Connect Audio Input  “R” Cable With PF, That PF Is Connected With 9no Leg Of Sound IC. Connect Audio Input “L” Cable With PF, That PF Is Connected With 1no Leg Of Sound IC. At Last Connect Audio Input “G” Cable With 8no Leg Of Sound IC. 
Now We Connect Speaker Cable With The Circuit. Connect “R” Side Speaker Cable With 6no & 8no Leg Of Sound IC. And Connect “L” Side Speaker Cable With 4no & 8no Leg Of Sound IC. 

Now We Tightly Connect Our Sound IC With The Heat Sink. 
Our Circuit Is Completely Ready For Use Now. Just Plug-In Power & Connect Audio Source With Audio Input Cable And Play Music. 
ENJOY The Music.
